# Networking
Now that we have designed our blockchain, let's try it out. First let's make sure it builds and installs:

```
$ sudo make install
```

Then, let's make sure it runs. We'll just run it in the foreground to see the output on standard out:
```
$ learncoind -debug -printtoconsole -regtest
```

If there are no errors, then we can run it in the background with:
```
$ learncoind -debug -printtoconsole -regtest -daemon
```

Let's import the private key for our genesis block premine transaction and see if we have a balance. Note genesis block transactions have a maturity time of 100 blocks, so we must mine 100 blocks as well. Let's convert the private key from chapter 3.2 to Wallet Import Format (WIF) to import to the Bitcoin Core wallet:
